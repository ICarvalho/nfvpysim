--> usar como medida para avaliar a taxa de aceitação de sfcs, variando a taxa de requisição de SFCs

Ex: 10/s ; 100/s 300/s etc

Average total bandwith x number of vnfs on the chain

(off-line phase)

-- Calculate all the shortest paths between all ingress and egress nodes

-- After getting HODs among vnfs, allocate them in the shortest path (in terms of number of hops) closest
   to the egress nodes.

(on-line phase)

-- Start sending sfc requests to the network;

-- find the closest nfv-node to the ingress node and check whether the sfc can be matched on it.

- run the service and collect metrics.
